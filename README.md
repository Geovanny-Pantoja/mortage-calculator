# mortage-calculator
Project created during my trainning at MSSA. 
The projects takes input from the user 
It first ask for home market price 
It validates that the information is correct 
Then it asks for the amount of the home loan (validates the information is correct)
Then it asks for the loan term 15 or 30 years. (valdiates the information is correct)
Then it asks for the amount of the DownPayment (validate the information is correct)
Then it asks for the yearly HOA amount. If no HOA amount, user inputs $0.00. (validates the information is correct)
Then it asks for the loan interest rate (validates information is correct)
The final value is the monthly income (validate information is correct) 
The output is: 
 - Inital loan amount (loan requested - downpayment)
 - The Home equity (pecentage of downpayment against the home market value)
 - Estimated property tax 
 - It lets the user know if a monthly loan insurance is requried based on the home equity
 - Gives the monthly loan payment before escrow
 - The total monthly payment after escrow
 - It lets the user know if the loan is approved base on the dept to income ration. 

As a bonus it creates a text file showing in an organized manner all inputs and outputs.
